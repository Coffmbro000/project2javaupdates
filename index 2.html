<h3>My Personal Favorites</h3>
<p>Van Halen might be my favorite band of all time. The style and the way they play is so fascinating to me. They have so many iconic hits that are still used for media today likes Movies and TV. One of my favorite songs from them is 
    "Dance the Night Away" the harmony of the other other members give a nice feeling to it. That song is more relaxed, one of my other favorite song from isnt as relaxed. It also involves no singing in it, that song is "Eruption" one of the greatest and most iconic guitar solo of all time.
    They have a wide range of songs that you can always find something that you will enjoy. Another one of my favorites is "Mean Street" one of their hidden gems in their line up of hits. It doesnt get enough recognition as it does.
