<h3>Who is "Pink Floyd"?</h3>
<p>Pink Floyd is a Psychedelic rock band who were very popular in 70's, they released many hits trhoughout their time. They were very different from many bands\
    with their long durations of their songs and the ways they expierenced with different techniques to create a psychedlic feel to them.

<br>
<h3> The History of Pink Floyd</h3>
<p>Pink Floyd started in London in the year of 1965, they were one of the first British psych bands to join the scene. 
    Founded by Syd Barret (lead vocalist/guitarist), Nick Mason (Drums), Roger Waters(bass guitar/vocals), and finally Richard Wright(keyboards/vocals)</p>
    <p> They debuted onto the scene with two singles that were recieved very well and their debut album "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn".
 years later in 1968 Guitarist and Vocalist "David Gilmour" would replace former member Syd Barret due to mental health issues. As years moved on Waters became
a huge part in the massive success of the band as he wrote most the lyrics for many hits. Throughout the 70's Pink Floyd dominated the psych rock scene
releasing many hit albums.</p>

<h3>My Personal Favorites</h3>
<p>I was suprised to find out those were the most streamed of the songs, considering the ones I'm going to list I here get talked about a lot more than those,
    two of my favorite songs from "The Darkside of the Moon" are "Time" and "Money" as the guiatr solos make those songs special and give a groovy vibe to them.
    Another hit I really enjoy is "Shine on You Crazy Diamond(Pt. 1-5)", this song is 15 minutes long but the duration is well worth it. The slow start at the beginning to leading into long guitar solos give it
    a peaceful and melodic vibe to it.
