<h3>Who are "The Eagles"?</h3>
<p>The Eagles is an American Rock band that were very popular in the 70's just like Pink Floyd. They are very well known as they helped establish country rock
    genre into the mainstream
</p>
<h3> The History of the Eagles</h3>
<p>The Band formed in the year of 1971 in the city of Los Angeles.</p>
    <p> Founded by Glenn Frey (Guitarist/Vocalist), Don Henley (Drummer/Vocalist), Bernie Leadon (Guitars/Vocalist), and Randy Meisner(Bass Guitar/Vocalist). They debuted with their album called "Eagles"
        (1972) with two hit singles that both were in the top 20 hits in the United States and Canada. Those hit singles being "Take it Easy" and "Witchy Women". In the year of 1974
    a new guitarist joined the band that being Don Felder. As years went by they continued to release many hit singles and albums, such as the single
"One of These Nights" and another album being "Hotel California" probably one of the most iconic albums of all time. </p>

<h3>My Personal Favorites</h3>
<p>My favorite Eagles song is "Hotel California" without a doubt, the melody of the song is so smoothing and has one of the best guitar solos of all Time.
    Another one of my favorite songs is "Nightingale" its a nice song to drive to at night. A lot of the eagles songs are different from a lot of rock as it isn't to fast paced and isn't to slow. Giving it a nice
    feeling to the songs. Without a doubt the Eagles are one of the most iconic bands of all time, they will have a permanent impact on music as a whole.
